#Puppet Firewall Management Module

Puppet module to manage firewall rules.

##Overview

This module provides a new type, firewall, for managing firewall rules. Only iptables is supported at the moment, though ip6tables, ipfw, pf, and ipf support is planned for future releases.

Currently, the iptables provider determines whether a rule exists using the name as a comment. Some older distros do not support iptables comments, which can cause issues.

This module was started as a replacement for the current [iptables module] (https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-iptables). As such, the interface has been left intact to allow users to easily migrate from one provider to the other.

##Usage
###iptables

  firewall { "0001-example-rule":
    iniface => 'lo',
    chain   => 'INPUT',
    jump    => 'ACCEPT'
  }

##Future Work

- Determine whether iptables supports comments and, if not, find a different way of diffing the rules
- Implement ip6tables
- Refactor type to allow for additional providers
- Find a way to create provider unit tests
